# MapComp

Implements two hashmaps one with linear probing and the other with serial chaining. Another tree map is also implemented. Comparison and time complexities are visualized by showing number of iterations required to find random usernamesa from test file. 

Compares the number of collisions occuring as size of mapo increases. Results are discussed within Test class and displayed when Test.java is run.
